- **Eight Buttons:** Arranged for easy access, each corresponding to a specific note.
- **Potentiometer fader:** Positioned on the side of the instrument, it is used to adjust the resonance frequency band of a filter.
- **USB-C Port:** For connecting the instrument to a computer for power and data.
